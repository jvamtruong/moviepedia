    "description": "Swinging London, 1969. From his apartment at Notting Hill Gate, Ray Purbbs edits an'underground' (that is, counter culture ) magazine, and Mouth, aided by his fellow hippies Alex, both Jill and Hugo. Ray is passionate about demonstration, ludicrously enthusiastic about every hip trend and convinced he's (or might be) a big player within the battle between the Establishment and the alternate society. Alex - though he also looks interested in golf than altering society and comes from a wealthy background - is coolness personified, a guy so laid he generally seems to exist outside reality. Jill embraces all the newfound liberty lent her gender and asserts to completely free love, though this attitude doesn't stretch for her'boyfriend'. Hugo is vague, almost glorious in his obliqueness. Led by Ray, the quartet hop onto every bandwagon and fail to make the slightest little difference they do. The gang are useless at all - in actuality, they aren't really good at being hippies.",
